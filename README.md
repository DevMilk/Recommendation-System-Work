* Feature Engineering and Binning techniques applied on Data to decrease RMSE on rating prediction

* Used Scikit-Suprise's SVD Collaborative Filtering Algorithm for predicting recommendations from only User-Item Matrix

* Used Apple's Turicreate's Recommender Algorithm to predict recommendation with user info.

* SVD algorithm reached approximately 0.11 Root Mean Square Error on Item rating prediction, Apple's TuriCreate Library's Recommender Algorithm reached 0.008 RMSE on Item rating prediction with given featurely engineered user informations which makes it a great recommender model.
